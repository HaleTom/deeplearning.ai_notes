# deeplearning.ai notes

My notes from the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) courses:

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks

The notes for courses 1-4 are extensive and include pretty $\LaTeX$ formulae.

For detailed course 5 notes, see the `lecture notes` heading under [learning resources](learning-resources.md).
