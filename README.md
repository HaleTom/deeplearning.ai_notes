# deeplearning.ai notes

My notes from the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) courses.

They all include pretty $\LaTeX$ formulae.  For viewing in Chrome, I recommend one of [these](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/math-anywhere/gebhifiddmaaeecbaiemfpejghjdjmhc?hl=en) [two](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/details) extensions.
